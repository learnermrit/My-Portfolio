    title: "HRMN99- Apple Plant",
    description:
        "This amazing apple variety has made life easier for farmers and agriculturists in Bilaspur and other lower hill districts of the state. Unlike other apple varieties, it doesn't require chilling hours for flowering and fruit setting. This has been a game changer for these regions, which never imagined being able to grow this popular fruit. Today, it serves as a source of inspiration for thousands of farmers who can now grow apples with ease and confidence.",

    title: "Dorsett Golden -Apple Plant",
    description:
        "With its unique features of thriving in warm climates and early blooming, the Anna apple variety, originally developed in Israel, bears striking similarities to this cultivar. In fact, they complement each other perfectly for cross-pollination.[3] As most apple cultivars, both of these varieties are self-incompatible and require pollination from another apple variety. Hence, farmers who cultivate either of these varieties would typically need to grow the other one alongside.",

  Project(
    title: "ANNA - Apple plant",
    description:
        "Anna apples have a skin color reminiscent of Golden Delicious apples, with a red flush covering around fifty percent of their green or greenish-yellow skin. They are perfect for snacking on fresh and keep their shape when cooked. These apples are self-sterile and are often grown alongside the Dorsett Golden variety or the Ein Shemer variety, both of which can also be grown in warm climates and cross-pollinate with Anna apples.",
